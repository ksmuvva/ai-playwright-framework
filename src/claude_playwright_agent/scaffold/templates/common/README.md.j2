## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js (for Playwright)

## Installation

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install {{ browser }}
```

## Usage

### Initialize a new recording

```bash
# Record a test scenario
cpa record --name login-scenario
```

### Ingest Playwright recordings

```bash
# Convert recordings to BDD scenarios
cpa ingest recordings/login-scenario.js
```

### Run tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cpa run

# Run specific feature
cpa run --features features/login.feature

# Run with specific browser
cpa run --browser firefox

# Run in parallel
cpa run --parallel 4
```

### View reports

```bash
# Generate and view HTML report
cpa report
```

## Configuration

Configuration is managed in `.cpa/config.yaml`:

```yaml
framework:
  bdd_framework: {{ framework }}
  base_url: {{ base_url }}

browser:
  browser: {{ browser }}
  headless: true

execution:
  parallel_workers: 1
  self_healing: {{ self_healing }}
```

## Self-Healing Selectors

{% if self_healing %}
This project has self-healing locators enabled. When a selector fails,
the agent will automatically attempt to find alternative selectors.
{% else %}
Self-healing locators are currently disabled. Enable in `.cpa/config.yaml`.
{% endif %}

## Next Steps

1. Record your first test scenario
2. Ingest the recording to generate BDD scenarios
3. Review and customize the generated tests
4. Run tests and review reports
